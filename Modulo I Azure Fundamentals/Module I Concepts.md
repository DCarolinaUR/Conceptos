# Azure Fundamentals :blue_book:
Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services range from simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud to running fully virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like AI and Internet of Things (IoT).

## Cloud Computing :cloud::computer:
Is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

- Lower your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.
  
## Cloud Service Models :cloud::fork_and_knife:
Cloud computing falls into one of the following computing models: **infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**, **platform as a service (PaaS)**, and **software as a service (SaaS)**. These models define the different level of shared responsibility that a cloud provider and cloud tenant are responsible for.

### IaaS :office:
This cloud service model is the closest to managing physical servers. A cloud provider keeps the hardware up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is left to the cloud tenant.

### PaaS :office::bar_chart:
This cloud service model is a managed hosting environment. The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.

### SaaS :office::bar_chart::iphone:
In this cloud service model, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.

## Serverless Computing :thought_balloon::office:
Serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.

## Cloud Deployment Models :cloud::rocket:
There are three deployment models for cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.

### Public Cloud :earth_americas::cloud:
Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources like servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet.
### Private Cloud :lock::cloud:
Computing resources are used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site datacenter. It also can be hosted by a third-party service provider.
### Hybrid Cloud :closed_lock_with_key::cloud:
This computing environment combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Azure Portal :ticket::house:
The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can:

- Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
- Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
- Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

## Azure Marketplace :ticket::pouch:
Azure Marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure.

## Azure Services :ticket::fork_and_knife:
Azure can help you tackle tough business challenges. You bring your requirements, creativity, and favorite software development tools. Azure brings a massive global infrastructure that's always available for you to build your applications on.
