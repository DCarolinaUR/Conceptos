# Azure Fundamentals :blue_book:
Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services range from simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud to running fully virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like AI and Internet of Things (IoT).

## Cloud Computing :cloud::computer:
Is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

- Lower your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.
  
## Cloud Service Models :cloud::fork_and_knife:
Cloud computing falls into one of the following computing models: **infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**, **platform as a service (PaaS)**, and **software as a service (SaaS)**. These models define the different level of shared responsibility that a cloud provider and cloud tenant are responsible for.
